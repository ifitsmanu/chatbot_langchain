This is why it\\'s considered the perfect place for life to exist! It\\'s also the only planet in the Solar System that has an atmosphere made up of nitrogen and oxygen.\\\\n\\\\nEarth is filled with incredible natural wonders, from the Grand Canyon to the Great Barrier Reef. It\\'s home to millions of species, from birds and mammals to tiny insects and plants. And it\\'s the only place in the universe where humans have been able to explore and learn about the world around them.\\\\n\\\\nEarth is also the only planet in the Solar System that has a moon. The moon, called Luna, is Earth\\'s closest celestial neighbor. It\\'s a fascinating body of rock that\\'s been studied extensively by scientists. We know that it\\'s responsible for the tides and has a huge effect on our planet\\'s climate.\\\\n\\\\nEarth is also constantly changing due to the forces of nature. Earthquakes, volcanoes, and storms can shape the landscape, while the climate is affected\"'}"

Thirdly, you need to let the dough sit for about 30 minutes, until it's risen. Fourthly, you need to roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface.
